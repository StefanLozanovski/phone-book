## Learning outcomes
You will learn a variety of sorting and search algorithms, one of which is recursive. If it is algorithm competence that you’re after, this project is definitely for you.
### Stage 1/4: A needle in the hay
Start with linear search: find data in an unordered database.

### Stage 2/4: Jumping bubbles
Sort your data before searching using Bubble Sort algorithm, and then apply Jump Search to find a number you’re after.

### Stage 3/4: Need for speed
Speed up the process with the help of QuickSort and Binary Search.
